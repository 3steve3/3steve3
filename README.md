## 🛠 Currently Architecting: V14 Composable Commerce OS
**Status:** Proprietary / Closed Source (Commercial Potential)
**Stack:** .NET 10 (LTS), PostgreSQL (TimescaleDB + PostGIS), gRPC, SignalR, Redis

V14 is a headless, modular commerce engine designed for sub-millisecond transactional 
latency and zero-copy data ingestion. 

### Key Architectural Pillars:
* **Memory Optimization:** Utilizing `ReadOnlySpan<T>` and `RecyclableMemoryStream` for zero-allocation ingestion pipelines.
* **Data-Oriented Design:** Leveraging C# 14 structs and devirtualized switch-based logic to maximize CPU cache locality.
* **Geospatial Integrity:** High-precision tracking using PostGIS spatial clustering.
* **Security First:** Built-in PII isolation and compliance-ready account purging logic (Apple 5.1.1v compliant).

## 🚀 Professional Expertise
* **Languages:** C# (.NET 10), SQL (Postgres/Timescale), Python, Rust (Learning), C++
* **Architectures:** Microservices, Event-Driven Architecture, Vertical Slice, B2B2C Multi-tenancy
* **Infrastucture:** AWS (EC2, S3, RDS), ARM64 (Graviton) Optimization, Linux/Windows Server
