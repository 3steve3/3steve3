## 🛠 Currently Architecting: V15 Composable Commerce OS
**Status:** Proprietary / Closed Source (Commercial Potential)
**Architectural Specification:** [View the Public Architecture & Schema Docs](https://github.com/3steve3/v15_architecture_spec/tree/main)

V15 is a headless, multi-tenant, composable operating system designed for high-integrity verticals like field services, automotive, and warehouse management. The architecture is engineered for sub-millisecond transactional latency and zero-copy data ingestion pipelines.

### Key Architectural Pillars:
* **Database-Level Security:** Enforcing multi-tenancy and data segregation via PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS).
* **Immutable Auditing:** Leveraging TimescaleDB hypertables for an append-only, tamper-proof audit trail of every state change.
* **Data-Oriented Performance:** Utilizing .NET 10/C# 14 structs and devirtualized logic to maximize CPU cache locality and minimize GC pressure.
* **Hybrid API Gateway:** Combining the strict performance of internal gRPC services with a flexible, public-facing GraphQL API for client applications.
